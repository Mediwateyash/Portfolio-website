            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello! I'm Yash Narayan Diwate, a Computer Engineering student at Watumull Institute of Electronic Engineering and Computer Technology. My coding journey began with a fascination for software development, and I have honed my skills in Java and Python. I completed my 12th standard at New English High School and Junior College, where my interest in engineering was sparked.</p>
            <p>I am passionate about exploring new technologies and applying my knowledge to real-world challenges. Outside of coding, I stay active through sports, running, and gym workouts. I also contribute to open-source projects, create algorithmic art, and participate in tech meetups and workshops. I am eager to collaborate with like-minded professionals and work on innovative projects that positively impact society.</p>
